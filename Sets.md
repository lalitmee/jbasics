# A Set in Mathematics

If you think back to mathematics, a set is a collection of distinct items. For example, `{2, 4, 5, 6}` is a set because each number is unique and appears only once. However, `{1, 1, 2, 4}` is *not* a set because it *contains duplicate entries* (the 1 is in there more than once!).

In JavaScript, we can already represent something similar to a mathematical set using an array.

```js
const nums = [2, 4, 5, 6];
```

However, arrays *do not enforce items to be unique*. If we try to add another `2` to `nums`, JavaScript won't complain and will add it without any issue.

```js
nums.push(2);
console.log(nums);
```

> ```
> [2, 4, 5, 6, 2]
> ```

…and now `nums` is no longer a set in the mathematical sense.



# Sets

In ES6, there’s a new built-in object that behaves like a mathematical set and works similarly to an array. This new object is conveniently called a "Set". The biggest differences between a set and an array are:

- Sets are not indexed-based - you do not refer to items in a set based on their position in the set
- items in a Set can’t be accessed individually

Basically, a Set is an object that lets you store unique items. You can add items to a Set, remove items from a Set, and loop over a Set. These items can be either primitive values or objects.



## How to Create a Set

There’s a couple of different ways to create a Set. The first way, is pretty straightforward:

```js
const games = new Set();
console.log(games);
```

> ```
> Set {}
> ```

This creates an empty Set `games` with no items.

If you want to create a Set from a list of values, you use an array:

```js
const games = new Set(['Super Mario Bros.', 'Banjo-Kazooie', 'Mario Kart', 'Super Mario Bros.']);
console.log(games);
```

> ```
> Set {'Super Mario Bros.', 'Banjo-Kazooie', 'Mario Kart'}
> ```

Notice the example above automatically removes the duplicate entry `"Super Mario Bros."` when the Set is created. Pretty neat!



## Modifying Sets

After you’ve created a Set, you’ll probably want to add and delete items from the Set. So how do you that? You use the appropriately named, `.add()` and `.delete()`methods:

```js
const games = new Set(['Super Mario Bros.', 'Banjo-Kazooie', 'Mario Kart', 'Super Mario Bros.']);

games.add('Banjo-Tooie');
games.add('Age of Empires');
games.delete('Super Mario Bros.');

console.log(games);
```

> ```
> Set {'Banjo-Kazooie', 'Mario Kart', 'Banjo-Tooie', 'Age of Empires'}
> ```

On the other hand, if you want to delete all the items from a Set, you can use the `.clear()` method.

```js
games.clear()
console.log(games);
```

> ```
> Set {}
> ```





> **TIP**: If you attempt to `.add()` a duplicate item to a Set, you won’t receive an error, but the item will not be added to the Set. Also, if you try to `.delete()` an item that is not in a Set, you won’t receive an error, and the Set will remain unchanged.

> `.add()` returns the `Set` if an item is successfully added. On the other hand, `.delete()` returns a Boolean (`true` or `false`) depending on successful deletion.



## Working With Sets

### Checking The Length

Once you’ve constructed your Set, there are a couple of different properties and methods you can use to work with Sets.

Use the `.size` property to return the number of items in a Set:

```js
const months = new Set(['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']);
console.log(months.size);
```

> ```
> 12
> ```

Remember, Sets can’t be accessed by their index like an array, so you use the `.size`property instead of `.length` property to get the size of the Set.

### Checking If An Item Exists

Use the `.has()` method to check if an item exists in a Set. If the item is in the Set, then `.has()` will return `true`. If the item doesn’t exist in the Set, then `.has()` will return `false`.

```js
console.log(months.has('September'));
```

> ```
> true
> ```

### Retrieving All Values

Finally, use the `.values()` method to return the values in a Set. The return value of the `.values()` method is a `SetIterator` object.

```js
console.log(months.values());
```

> ```
> SetIterator {'January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December'}
> ```

More on the `SetIterator` object in a second!





> **TIP**: The `.keys()` method will behave the exact same way as the `.values()` method by returning the values of a Set within a new Iterator Object. The `.keys()` method is an alias for the `.values()` method for similarity with maps. You’ll see the `.keys()`method later in this lesson during the Maps section.

## Looping over Sets

The last step to working with Sets is looping over them.

If you remember back to our discussion on the new *iterable* and *iterator protocols* in ES6, then you’ll recall that Sets are built-in iterables. This means two things in terms of looping:

1. You can use the Set’s default iterator to step through each item in a Set, one by one.
2. You can use the new `for...of` loop to loop through each item in a Set.

## Using the SetIterator

Because the `.values()` method returns a new iterator object (called `SetIterator`), you can store that iterator object in a variable and loop through each item in the Set using `.next()`.

```js
const iterator = months.values();
iterator.next();
```

> ```
> Object {value: 'January', done: false}
> ```

And if you run `.next()` again?

```js
iterator.next();
```

> ```
> Object {value: 'February', done: false}
> ```

And so on until `done` equals `true` which marks the end of the Set.

## Using a `for...of` Loop

An easier method to loop through the items in a Set is the `for...of` loop.

```js
const colors = new Set(['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'violet', 'brown', 'black']);
for (const color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
```

> red 
> orange 
> yellow 
> green 
> blue 
> violet 
> brown 
> black
